This is a java based Online Grocery Management web application. Here I used .jsp for frontend and JDBC for connecting database with jsp pages, and backend as sql lite. 
com.grocery.beans package contains all getters and setters files
com.grocery.dao handles database implementation
com.grocery.services contains servlet files 
com.grocery.utils contains database connection
